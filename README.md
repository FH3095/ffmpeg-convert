# ffmpeg-convert
Tool to batch convert files from one folder to another folder via ffmpeg.<br/>
Rename "example.settings.ini" to "settings.ini" and change settings.<br/>
You can create new sections as needed.<br/>
You can either call the tool by hand and enter the section-name by hand or pass the section-name as first parameter.<br/>

This is primarily for my own personal use so I will only add features I need. Feel free to fork and add your own features if needed.
